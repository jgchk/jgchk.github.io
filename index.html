<p>the circumstances surrounding weed legalization are surreal. through some legismagick intentionally built to appease the suburban pot-calling hovermoms, "thc" remains rhetorically illegal while head shops quietly dish out vapes, edibles, and flower with legal thc analogues. we've bought a 100 foot ethernet cable to weave around walls and furniture to reach a port that is just 10 feet away on the floorplan.</p>

<p>whatever. buy some weed, dont buy some weed. choose something and explore as far as you can, loops and all. you may even end up back at the beginning.</p>

<p>after quite a long break from marijuana, i came across some ideas that buffed out the rust and brought new possibilities to the experience.</p>

<p>the first night was incredible. the substance completely dissolved the thoughtwall between experience and idea. no longer was i observing multiplicity from a distance - multiplicity just was. lines of flight were plain to see, physically selectable from the air as they popped into view. flows felt natural, not something to be argued for or against but something to take hold of and follow to the next without judgement. situations were no longer "ah i fucked up, lets reset and try this again fresh" but rather an effortless continuation through the node into a new advantageous line. lodged on a stratum, producing flow conjunctions, trying continuums of intensities segment by segment.</p>

<p>how sad that this ends so quickly. day 2 brought only a shadow of the experience. with no shortage of effort, this spark was present for only 10 minutes or so before devolving into braindead externalization. lets just feed on some dopamine for a bit, no big deal. man, does this feel like a waste. day 3 - the exact opposite of my initial experience. no longer dextrous and abundant, lines of flight were completely obscured from view presenting no opportunities for expansion (or escape) from the singular mind.</p>

<p>i tossed the rest in the garbage. though delta 8 presented a wonderful view into the machinic world, i cant help but picture it as one of those spiralling coin roller things you used to see at malls. quite fun to see your little quarter rolling around and around picking up speed but ultimately it drops in the central hole and disappears into the obscured mass of copper and nickel built up by everyone who has played before</p>
