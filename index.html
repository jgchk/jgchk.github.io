        the circumstances surrounding weed legalization feel like a strange
        dream. through some 2018 Farm Bill legismagick built to simultaneously
        appease suburban hovermoms and chronic coughers alike, "thc" remains
        rhetorically illegal while head shops quietly dish out vapes, edibles,
        and flower with legal thc analogues. everyone gets their way (and
        good!!, yet what a winding road we've had to take to get here. as one
        friend might put it, we've bought a 100 foot ethernet cable to weave
        around walls and furniture to reach a port that is really just behind
        some shit 10 feet away)

        whatever. buy some weed, dont buy some weed. choose something and
        explore as far as you can, loops and all. you may even end up back at
        the beginning..

        so, after quite a long break from marijuana, i came across some ideas
        that buffed out the rust and brought new possibilities to the
        experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        the first night was incredible. the substance completely dissolved the
        thoughtwall between experience and idea. no longer was i observing
        multiplicity from a distance - multiplicity just was. lines of flight
        were plain to see, physically selectable from the air as they popped
        into view. flows felt natural, not something to be argued for or against
        but something to take hold of and follow to the next without judgement.
        situations were no longer "ah i fucked up, lets reset and try this again
        fresh" but rather an effortless continuation through the node into a new
        advantageous line. lodged on a stratum, producing flow conjunctions,
        trying continuums of intensities segment by segment.

        how sad that this ends so quickly. day 2 brought only a shadow of the
        experience. with no shortage of effort, the spark was present for only
        10 minutes before devolving into braindead externalization. lets just
        feed on some dopamine for a bit, no big deal... man, does it feel like a
        waste. day 3, further towards the pole opposing my initial experience
        (and how fitting, re-locked into dialectic thinking (and perhaps even
        that's giving it too much credit...)) no longer dextrous and abundant,
        lines of flight were completely obscured from view presenting no
        opportunities for movement or expansion from the singular mind.

        i tossed the rest in the garbage. though delta 8 presented a wonderful
        view into the machinic world, i cant help but picture it as one of those
        spiralling coin roller things you used to see at malls. quite fun to see
        your little quarter rolling around and around picking up speed but
        ultimately it drops in the central hole and disappears into the obscured
        mass of copper and nickel
